# dbdbingo

## Project Description
This project serves as a way for both veteran and newcomer players alike to spice up their gameplay in the video game Dead By Daylight. This is a recreation of a website I made a while ago at [dbdbingo.com](https://dbdbingo.com/), but I wanted to recreate the basic JavaScript website using Vue and wanted to overall update it to account for the more recent game updates.
